**HOW TO RUN THE APP?**

1. First, download the project from the Github repository.

2. Open the downloaded project in Android Studio.

3. Now install the app on your smartphone by connecting the phone with the laptop using USB. (Or one could use an android emulator also). Before installing the app on    the phone, make sure your phone’s Debugging mode is ON.

4. The Debugging mode could be enabled by tapping multiple times on the Developer option present in the settings of your phone. The number oftimes you tap will vary      from phone to phone.

5. Finally, run the app and use it by trying out different activities.

**APP FUNCTIONALITY**

The android application developed for human activity recognition is capable of predicting the probabilities of activities like walking, sitting, standing, jogging,
running, walking upstairs, and walking downstairs. Once the app is run, clicking on the SHOW STATS button will give the probability of each activity, and the
activity with the highest probability is spoken aloud. The activity with the highest probability is the activity we are presently doing.

As the user has their phone kept in his/her pocket, so the activity that he/she is doing will be spoken by the app (the activity which has highest probability).

Below are the screenshots of our app developed.
